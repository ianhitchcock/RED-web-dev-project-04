## New technologies used

Word press and a little bit of php

## Personal learnings

Beyond learning a bunch about Word Press, I found that I understand CSS flexbox better, as well as a basic understanding of the system architecture of a site and server.

I found it very challenging to keep my css organized, and the more I added, the messier it got. I think in the future I will refactor when refactoring is a small job, not a huge job at the end.

## To Do

- Tidy and restructure scss (sorry its such a mess)
- do adventure custom post type
- make the contect widget more user friendly
